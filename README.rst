Preparing a release
*******************

TODO: How do we update the documentation on github pages?

On master:

1. Update and check CHANGELOG.md.

2. Increment version number and remove ``+dev`` suffix
   IN BOTH ``setup.py`` AND ``httpkom/version.py``!

3. Test manually by using jskom.

4. Commit, push.

5. Tag (annotated) with ``v<version>`` (example: ``v0.1``) and push the tag::

       git tag -a v0.1 -m "Version 0.1"
       git push origin v0.1

6. Build PyPI dist: ``make dist``

7. Push to Test PyPI: ``twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`` and check
   https://test.pypi.org/project/httpkom/ .

8. Push to PyPI: ``twine upload dist/*`` and check
   https://pypi.org/project/httpkom/ .

9. Add ``+dev`` suffix to version number, commit and push.

10. Github release: Go to https://github.com/osks/httpkom/releases
    and draft a new release. Select tag and set title to "Version
    <version>", and then publish the release.


Tools
*****

Install and update release tools with::

    pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel pip twine

Twine is used for pushing the built dist to PyPI. The examples in the
release process depends on a ``.pypirc`` file with config for the pypi
and testpypi repositories.

Example of ``.pypirc``::

    [pypi]
    username = __token__
    password = pypi-...

    [testpypi]
    repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    username = __token__
    password = pypi-...
